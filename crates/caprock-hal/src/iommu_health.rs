//! **Arch-neutral IOMMU health — one statement, two implementations.**
//!
//! Until now each architecture reported the health of its own unit in its own words: aarch64
//! printed `smmu` (IDR0, SIDSIZE, SMMUEN, CMD_SYNC round trip, event queue, GERROR), x86 printed
//! `iommu`/`vtdcaps`/`vtdgrp` (version, CAP, GSTS.TES, context-cache acknowledgement). Both
//! implementations are complete — but there was **no single sentence that means the same thing on
//! both sides**, and `todo.md` had named that in advance as the warning sign: *"a separate
//! `vtdtest` would mean the properties are worded differently on x86, and then a second design
//! does exist after all."*
//!
//! This module is that one sentence. It is a **pure type over injected values** — it reads no
//! register and calls into no architecture module, which is what makes it host-testable on its own
//! (the pattern of `dmar.rs` and `irte.rs`; `caprock-hal` as a whole never builds on the host).
//! The two facades in `x86_64/iommu.rs` and `aarch64/iommu.rs` gather the values and hand them in.
//!
//! ## The load-bearing rule of this module
//!
//! **`faults_empty` on its own is not a result.** An IOMMU that is wedged, unconfigured or simply
//! not answering also reports an empty fault queue — that is exactly the trap this project has
//! already paid for twice (SMMUv3 without `CD.R`: the event queue is *structurally* empty, and an
//! empty buffer looks like "no errors"; and virtio-rng, which only ever *wrote*, so the read
//! direction was never exercised).
//!
//! Therefore [`IommuHealth::ok`] weighs `faults_empty` **only** when
//! `invalidation_round_trip` is true. That flag is the liveness proof: the unit was given an
//! invalidation and it **acknowledged completion** — on aarch64 through the `CMD_SYNC` round trip,
//! on x86 through the QI wait descriptor writing its status word (or, while QI is off, `CCMD.ICC`
//! being cleared again). A unit that acknowledges is a unit that could have spoken.
